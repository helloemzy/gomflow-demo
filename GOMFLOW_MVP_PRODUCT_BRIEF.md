# GOMFLOW MVP: Product Brief & Design Document
## The Linktree for Group Orders

### Executive Summary

**Product Name**: GOMFLOW MVP  
**Tagline**: "Create beautiful order pages in 30 seconds"  
**Launch Timeline**: 5 days  
**Budget**: $12 (domain only)  
**Target**: 10 GOMs processing 300+ orders in first 30 days  

**Core Value Proposition**: Give GOMs a professional storefront link they can share anywhere, eliminating the chaos of Google Forms and manual payment tracking.

---

## The Problem (Refined)

Current GOM workflow:
1. Create Google Form (ugly, no payment info, limited)
2. Share link across multiple platforms repeatedly
3. Answer "how do I pay?" 50+ times
4. Track payments in spreadsheet hell
5. No professional presence or trust signals

**The Insight**: GOMs don't need complex software - they need a professional-looking page that handles the basics and works with their existing distribution channels.

---

## The Solution: GOMFLOW Links

### One-Line Pitch
"Linktree for group orders - create a beautiful order page with payment instructions in 30 seconds and share one link everywhere."

### How It Works
1. **Sign up** (Google auth, 10 seconds)
2. **Create a drop** (product info + payment methods, 30 seconds)  
3. **Get your link** (`gomflow.link/yourname/seventeen-album`)
4. **Share anywhere** (WhatsApp, Twitter, Discord, Instagram bio)
5. **Track orders** (simple list with payment status)

---

## User Personas (Ultra-Focused)

### Primary: Sarah the Overworked GOM
- **Current pain**: Spends 3 hours setting up each group order across platforms
- **Behavior**: Copies and pastes the same payment info 100+ times
- **Need**: One professional link that works everywhere
- **Success metric**: Sets up new drops in under 1 minute

### Secondary: Lisa the Anxious Buyer  
- **Current pain**: Confused about payment methods and order status
- **Behavior**: DMs GOM repeatedly asking for payment details
- **Need**: Clear, professional page with all info in one place
- **Success metric**: Completes order without needing to DM

4. How do buyers discover the drops?

---

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
```
Risk: Supabase free tier limits
Mitigation: 500MB is ~500K orders, upgrade at $25/month if needed

Risk: Vercel function timeouts
Mitigation: Keep all operations under 10 seconds, use edge functions

Risk: Domain gets blocked
Mitigation: Register backup domains, use subdomains if needed
```

### Market Risks
```
Risk: GOMs don't want to change tools
Mitigation: Works alongside current tools, not replacement

Risk: Buyers confused by new flow
Mitigation: Make it clearer than Google Forms

Risk: Payment disputes
Mitigation: Clear disclaimer - we don't process payments (yet)
```

---

## Decision Log

### Why these choices?

1. **Linktree model**: Familiar pattern, proven to work
2. **No payment processing**: Reduces complexity by 90%
3. **Single link focus**: Solves #1 pain - sharing payment info repeatedly
4. **5 fields only**: Forces ultra-simple first version
5. **Supabase**: Free tier generous, scales well, includes auth
6. **No messaging**: GOMs already have distribution channels

### What we're betting on

The core bet: **GOMs want a professional storefront more than automation**. 

If true, we can add automation later. If false, we learn in 5 days for $12.

---

## Summary

GOMFLOW MVP is a 5-day experiment to validate that GOMs will use a link-in-bio style tool for group orders. By stripping everything except the core value (professional order pages), we can test the market with minimal investment and maximum learning speed.

**The dream**: In 30 days, Sarah the GOM posts "Just discovered @gomflow - turned my chaotic Google Forms into a professional shop in literally 30 seconds ü§Ø"

**The reality**: We'll know in 5 days if this solves a real problem.
