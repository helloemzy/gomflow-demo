## Technical Architecture: Claude Code Friendly

### Core Stack (100% Claude Compatible)

```typescript
// Tech stack optimized for Claude Code
Technology: {
  frontend: "Next.js 14 + TypeScript",
  backend: "Next.js API routes",
  database: "Supabase (PostgreSQL)",
  auth: "Supabase Auth (Google OAuth)",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui",
  deployment: "Vercel",
  storage: "Supabase Storage"
}

// External services (API consumption only)
ExternalAPIs: {
  optional: ["OpenAI Vision API", "Twilio API"],
  workarounds: "Manual processes with upgrade path"
}
```

### Database Schema (Claude Code Designed)

```sql
-- Users (GOMs)
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT,
  username TEXT UNIQUE,
  phone TEXT,
  country TEXT DEFAULT 'PH',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Orders/Products (simplified)
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  currency TEXT DEFAULT 'PHP',
  deadline TIMESTAMP,
  payment_info TEXT, -- JSON with payment methods
  slug TEXT UNIQUE,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Buyers/Submissions
CREATE TABLE submissions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  order_id UUID REFERENCES orders(id),
  buyer_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  buyer_phone TEXT NOT NULL,
  buyer_platform TEXT, -- WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord
  quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  payment_reference TEXT UNIQUE, -- Auto-generated
  payment_proof_url TEXT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending', -- pending, paid, overdue
  source_platform TEXT, -- Track where they came from
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Messages (for tracking communication)
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  submission_id UUID REFERENCES submissions(id),
  message_type TEXT, -- reminder, confirmation, custom
  content TEXT,
  platform TEXT,
  sent_at TIMESTAMP,
  status TEXT -- pending, sent, failed
);
```

### Smart Workarounds for Complex Features

#### 1. Multi-Platform Messaging (Claude Friendly Approach)

Instead of real-time API integration, provide **intelligent copy-paste helpers**:

```typescript
// helpers/messageGenerator.ts
export const generatePlatformMessage = (
  platform: 'whatsapp' | 'telegram' | 'discord',
  template: 'reminder' | 'confirmation' | 'instructions',
  data: SubmissionData
) => {
  const templates = {
    whatsapp: {
      reminder: `Hi ${data.buyerName}! ⏰ Just a reminder that payment for ${data.orderTitle} (${data.totalAmount}) is due soon. Your reference code: ${data.paymentReference}`,
    },
    telegram: {
      reminder: `🔔 Payment Reminder\n**${data.orderTitle}**\nAmount: ${data.totalAmount}\nReference: \`${data.paymentReference}\`\nDeadline: ${data.deadline}`,
    },
    discord: {
      reminder: `@${data.buyerName} Payment reminder for **${data.orderTitle}** - ${data.totalAmount}\nReference: \`${data.paymentReference}\``,
    }
  };
  
  return templates[platform][template];
};
```

#### 2. Payment Screenshot Analysis (Progressive Enhancement)

**Phase 1**: Manual verification with smart helpers
```typescript
// components/PaymentVerification.tsx
const PaymentVerification = ({ submission }) => {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <img src={submission.paymentProofUrl} className="max-w-md" />
      
      <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded">
        <p>Looking for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Amount: ₱{submission.totalAmount}</li>
          <li>Reference: {submission.paymentReference}</li>
          <li>Recipient: Your payment details</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div className="flex gap-2">
        <button onClick={() => markAsPaid(submission.id)} 
                className="bg-green-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">
          ✅ Verified - Mark as Paid
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => requestMoreInfo(submission.id)}
                className="bg-yellow-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">
          ❓ Request Clearer Image
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => rejectPayment(submission.id)}
                className="bg-red-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">
          ❌ Reject Payment
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Phase 2**: Add OpenAI Vision API
```typescript
// utils/paymentAnalysis.ts
export const analyzePaymentScreenshot = async (imageUrl: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/analyze-payment', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ imageUrl }),
  });
  
  return response.json(); // { amount, reference, confidence }
};
```

#### 3. Smart Dashboard (Claude Code Strength)

```typescript
// components/Dashboard.tsx
const Dashboard = () => {
  const [orders] = useState([]); // From Supabase
  const [filter, setFilter] = useState('all');
  
  const stats = useMemo(() => ({
    totalOrders: submissions.length,
    paidOrders: submissions.filter(s => s.status === 'paid').length,
    pendingAmount: submissions
      .filter(s => s.status === 'pending')
      .reduce((sum, s) => sum + s.totalAmount, 0),
    overdueCount: submissions.filter(s => 
      s.status === 'pending' && 
      new Date(s.createdAt) < subDays(new Date(), 2)
    ).length
  }), [submissions]);
  
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* Quick Stats */}
      <div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
        <StatCard title="Total Orders" value={stats.totalOrders} />
        <StatCard title="Paid" value={stats.paidOrders} />
        <StatCard title="Pending Amount" value={`₱${stats.pendingAmount}`} />
        <StatCard title="Overdue" value={stats.overdueCount} color="red" />
      </div>
      
      {/* Quick Actions */}
      <div className="flex gap-2 flex-wrap">
        <button onClick={() => generateBulkReminders('pending')}>
          📢 Message All Pending
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => generateBulkReminders('overdue')}>
          ⚠️ Message Overdue
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => exportToCSV()}>
          📄 Export Orders
        </button>
      </div>
      
      {/* Orders List */}
      <OrdersList 
        submissions={filteredSubmissions} 
        onStatusChange={updateSubmissionStatus}
        onMessage={generateMessage}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```
