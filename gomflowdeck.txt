Target User

(first targeting kpop & anime fans)

GOM
(Group Order Manager)
Currently spends 15-20 hours per
order managing payments
manually through spreadsheets.
Loses 30% of potential orders due
to payment chaos. Needs
automated tracking, instant buyer
updates, and professional tools to
scale their business.

Microsellers
/Creators

Buyers / Fans

Launches exclusive merchandise
drops but struggles with order
management. Needs pre-order
capabilities, inventory tracking, and
real-time demand data. Wants to
focus on creating, not spreadsheet
juggling.

Anxious about payment security and
order status. Constantly DMs GOMs
asking "did you get my payment?" Wants
transparency, real-time updates, and to
discover trending group orders before
they close.

Anime Figure Collectors

Anime fans extensively use group orders for figures, especially
limited editions from Japan. Forums like MyFigureCollection and
Reddit r/AnimeFigures show similar group buying behavior to Kpop. Japanese exclusive releases drive this need.

Mechanical-keyboard artisans
KeebFinder lists 236 active group buys for keycaps/keyboard
kits at any given time. Buyers pre-pay to hit MOQ before
production starts.

Sneaker cook groups

GQ’s feature “Buying Rare Sneakers Is Almost Impossible—Unless
You Join a Cook Group” profiles Discord groups coordinating Travis
Scott Nike drops for thousands of paying members.
