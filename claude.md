- **Payment tracking** (6-8 hours): 
  - Matching payment screenshots to buyer names
  - Cross-referencing multiple payment platforms
  - Manual Excel updates for each transaction
  - Following up on unclear payments
- **Communication overhead** (4-6 hours):
  - Individual DMs to each buyer for updates
  - Answering "did you receive my payment?" 50+ times
  - Copy-pasting the same information repeatedly
- **Order finalization** (2-3 hours):
  - Manual count verification
  - Calculating individual shipping costs
  - Creating shipping labels one by one

#### 2. Payment Anxiety & Risk
**Current Payment Methods & Issues:**
- **PayPal Friends & Family**: No buyer protection, 3% currency conversion loss
- **Bank transfers**: 24-48 hour clearing time, no automated confirmation
- **GCash/local wallets**: Regional fragmentation, manual screenshot verification
- **Cryptocurrency**: High volatility, technical barriers for buyers

**Financial Impact:**
- 30% of potential orders lost due to payment friction
- 5-10% payment disputes requiring manual resolution

#### 3. Scale Limitations
**Growth Constraints:**
- **Order ceiling**: Manual processes cap GOMs at 50-300 orders/month
- **Opportunity cost**: GOMs reject 40% of partnership opportunities due to capacity
- **Income ceiling**: Indonesian GOMs earn 3.5x national average ($900/month) but cannot scale further
- **Burnout rate**: 45% of GOMs quit within first year due to stress

**Hidden Costs:**
- Lost bulk discounts from suppliers (10-15% margin improvement unavailable)
- Inability to negotiate better shipping rates without volume data
- Missing seasonal peaks (comeback seasons see 3x demand)
