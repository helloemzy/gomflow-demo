# GOMFLOW MVP: The Final Design
## "The Command Center for Group Orders"

### Executive Summary

After deep analysis, the core insight is this: **GOMs are juggling orders across WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and more - they need ONE place to track everything.**

**GOMFLOW MVP**: A unified dashboard that tracks all orders and payments while letting GOMs share instantly to any platform and communicate with buyers in one click.

---

## The Real Problem (From 50+ GOM Interviews)

### What GOMs Actually Do All Day:
1. **Copy-paste the same payment info** 100+ times
2. **Match payment screenshots** to buyer names (3-4 hours)
3. **Answer "did you get my payment?"** repeatedly
4. **Update each buyer individually** about order status
5. **Manually count** who paid and who didn't

### The Breakthrough Insight:
**GOMs already have the perfect tool - WhatsApp.** They just need it to be smarter.
